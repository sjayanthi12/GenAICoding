🧠 GenAICoding
GenAICoding is a smart assistant that helps you work with Jira by using simple language. Instead of learning complex Jira commands, just type what you want — and the system will do it for you using AI.

Whether you want to create a task, update an issue, or check on progress, GenAICoding makes Jira easy.

✅ What Can GenAICoding Do?
Talk to Jira in plain English
Just type your request, like:
“Create a task to fix login bugs by Monday.”

Create and update tasks
The assistant understands what you want and handles it for you.

Works securely with your own accounts
You use your own keys (passwords/tokens) to connect your accounts, so everything stays private and secure.

🧰 What Does It Use Behind the Scenes?
You don’t need to worry about the technical details, but here’s what powers GenAICoding:

OpenAI (ChatGPT) — Understands what you mean

Jira — Where your tasks live

LangChain — Helps everything work together

Secure Settings — Keeps your login details safe using a .env file

🔧 How to Set It Up
You might need help from your technical team for the setup. But if you're comfortable, here’s a simplified guide:

1. 📥 Download the Tool
First, get the tool onto your computer:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenAICoding.git
cd GenAICoding
2. 🔐 Add Your Login Info
You’ll need to add your API keys (secure access codes) for OpenAI and Jira.

Copy the example file:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Open the new .env file

Fill in your information:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
JIRA_DOMAIN=yourcompany.atlassian.net
These keys let the assistant talk to Jira and OpenAI on your behalf.

3. 📦 Install What’s Needed
Run these commands:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs all the tools needed to make the system run.

4. ▶️ Start Using It
Once everything is set up, run:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Now you can just type what you want it to do.

Example:

“Create a task for the design team to update the mobile app icon.”

The tool will understand and create a task in Jira — automatically.

❓ Common Problems
It says the API key is invalid
→ Double-check your .env file — are your keys correct?

Jira won’t connect
→ Make sure you’re using your email and API token (not your password).

Something’s not working
→ Try re-running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt```
🤝 Want to Improve It?
If you're working with a developer, they can add features or make changes. Here’s how they contribute:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b new-feature
git commit -m "Add something new"
git push origin new-feature
Then they open a Pull Request (PR) to suggest changes.
